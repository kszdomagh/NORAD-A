----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-689] width (7) of port connection 'sseg' does not match port width (8) of module 'disp_hex_mux' [C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/oscilo_game_uec/fpga/rtl/top_basys3.sv:245]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port inx[8] in module valid_buf is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port iny[8] in module valid_buf is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-3936] Found unconnected internal register 'read_rw_reg' and it is trimmed from '16' to '10' bits. [C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/oscilo_game_uec/rtl/template_ram.sv:48]

WARNING: [Synth 8-6430] The Block RAM "template_ram:/ram_reg" may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use attribute (* rw_addr_collision= "yes" *) to avoid collision 
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met
WARNING: [Synth 8-6430] The Block RAM "u_top_rtl/u_RAM_module/ram_reg" may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use attribute (* rw_addr_collision= "yes" *) to avoid collision 
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_bresenham/FSM_onehot_state_reg[0]) is unused and will be removed from module top_vector_display.
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_missile_fire_control/u_bresenham/FSM_onehot_state_reg[0]) is unused and will be removed from module game_logic_top.

----IMPLEMENTATION----
CLEAR :)
