WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port iny[8] in module valid_buf is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port btnC in module cursor is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-3936] Found unconnected internal register 'read_rw_reg' and it is trimmed from '16' to '10' bits. [C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/oscilo_game_uec/rtl/template_ram.sv:48]
WARNING: [Synth 8-3936] Found unconnected internal register 'read_r_reg' and it is trimmed from '16' to '10' bits. [C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/oscilo_game_uec/rtl/template_ram.sv:49]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6430] The Block RAM "template_ram:/ram_reg" may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use attribute (* rw_addr_collision= "yes" *) to avoid collision
